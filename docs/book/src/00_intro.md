# The Living Codex of Axur Web

Welcome to the central nervous system of **Axur Web**. 

This documentation is not a static manual; it is a **Living Codex** that evolves synchronously with the codebase. It unifies:

1.  **The Manual (Part I)**: Human-readable guides for deployment and operations.
2.  **The Memory (Part II)**: The AI Agent's internal context, architectural decisions, and lessons learned.
3.  **The Law (Part III)**: The Constitution and strict governance protocols.

## How to Read This
- **Operators**: Start with [Part I](../../.agent/workflows/deploy.md).
- **Developers**: Review [The Constitution](../../.agent/rules/00_CONSTITUTION.md) before pushing code.
- **Agents**: Index `knowledge/` before planning new features.
