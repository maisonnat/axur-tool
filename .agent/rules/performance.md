# PERFORMANCE & HYGIENE PROTOCOL
1. **Context Management:** At the end of every significant task, generate a `SUMMARY.md` updating the current state of the module.
2. **Session Cleanup:** Remind the user to close this chat session once the `SUMMARY.md` is saved to free up system resources.
3. **Plan First:** Before writing code for a new feature, ALWAYS generate an `Implementation Plan` artifact for review.
